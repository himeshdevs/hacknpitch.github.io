                        ">As a student we are already investing in Education and the 2nd Investment you can possibly do is that Investing in Mutual Funds. Following are the reasons why to invest in mutual funds.
                            <br><br>For many of us its difficult to work full time while studying, so it is difficult to invest in Stock Market, Government Bonds, Real Estate as it requires Huge Sum of money. Which is very difficult to earn while studying.
                            So Mutual Funds is the only option we have left.
                            <br> <br>Secondly we as a student you tend invest in aggressive investment options. So with some surplus money or scholarship money or pocket money one can start to invest in Mutual Funds.
                            <br><br> One of the biggest and important rule of investment in mutual fund is “Early you start, more you Gain”. And Secondly learning the habit of saving at the early age will be beneficial for you in future<span id="dots">...</span>
                            <span class="moreText " id="more" style="display:none ">
                                <br><br> Fourth and the last reason instead of keeping your money in saving account in bank with an annual interest of 3–4% or putting it in Fixed Deposit with an annual interest of 6–8.5% is again less as compared to some
                                MF’s (Mutual Funds) in market. Think about the Risk. Because In every part of our life we always take risk to do new things, to experience, to learn. So “Risk is an inseparable part of our life”</span>

                                    <div class="accordion-body">There is a large difference between shares. There are shares which do not increase in years and often fall but then suddenly increase in a short span of time. Then again there are shares which steadily increase over
                                        the years. But we generally never invest in a single share. When investing we diversify thus creating a portfolio of stocks i.e. investing in at least 8-10 companies. This acts as a backup if any of our investments
                                        fail. Thus with a basket of stocks we can expect about 18-20% returns in long run (min 5 years). This would hold true especially for a High Growth Economy like the Indian Economy. Thus the returns for Stock Market
                                        is about 3x more than FD and 2x more than Gold/Real Estate.Now even in low growth economies there are people who picked their stocks as such that they were able to get about 30% growth rate. Thus in a country like
                                        India, expecting about 20% returns is realistic tough the stock picking needs to good as well.</div>

                                    <div class="accordion-body">In stock market the selection of stocks with consistent returns is more important than the total amount of capital invested. Eg. Rs 1000 per month And increase this Rs 1000/month by 15% Thus in Year1: Rs 1000 x 12 =Rs
                                        12000 In Year2: Rs1150 x 12 =Rs 13800 And so on. Thus if we expect even 15% returns after 25 years we can expect Rs 1 Crore. Now a few points to be noted is: Investment needs to made each year during this time span.
                                        And each year this needs to increased by 15% Expecting 15% returns. This was calculated using an SIP Calculator as the one given below. *Insert SIP Calculator*(HIMESH)</div>

                                        this is true in some rare cases where such events occur. But they are not common at all and thus people with these false expectations loose out. If you hurry and invest without any research just by hearing about
                                        a share and buying it it would be just a gamble and you would be loosing out money. Thus patience is key and expectations need to be realistic. With 18-20% returns the money doubles in 4 years which is about 1/3rd

                                        told to some Charter Accountants who are known to be extremely knowledgeable in commerce stuff. The shocking result was that after 5 years the shares picked by the kids outperformed the shares picked by the CAs.
                                        Now a theory on how this happened: The kids chose the brands in which they were interested, brands like Cadbury, Disney, Barbie, the kids were customers of the products of these companies and thus knew the products
                                        they invested in best. The kids picked the companies satisfying the customers more. Where as the CAs did a lot of complicated calculations but still missed out on the ground reality. I. E. The company which satisfies
